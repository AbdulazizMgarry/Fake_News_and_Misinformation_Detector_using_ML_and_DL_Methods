# üß† Fake News & Misinformation Detector

An intelligent system that detects fake and misleading news using both **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques.  
Developed as a **Samsung Innovation Campus Capstone Project** by **Vision Group**.

## üìò Introduction

Fake news spreads quickly across social media and can distort public opinion.  
Our system identifies whether a piece of news is **real or fake** using NLP-based text analysis and AI models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Overview

**Dataset:** [Kaggle - Fake News Classification](https://www.kaggle.com)  
**Techniques Used:**
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Feature Extraction using **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec**
- Model Training with:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Evaluation using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
  - Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve

## üß© Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Import Kaggle dataset  
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean, tokenize, and normalize text  
3. **Feature Extraction:** Create numerical representations  
4. **Modeling:** Train and validate ML and DL models  
5. **Evaluation:** Compare performance and visualize metrics

## üìä Model Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.94 | 0.93 | 0.94 |
| SVM | 0.95 | 0.95 | 0.95 |
| LSTM | **0.96** | **0.96** | **0.96** |

**LSTM achieved the best overall performance.**
